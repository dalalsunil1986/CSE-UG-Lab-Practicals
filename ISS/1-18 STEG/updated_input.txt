Cryptography means  to  convert our  plain text data into the  unreadable  form.  This is  the subject we are  being  taught  is this  semester. By now you  would  have  realized that I am just playing  with  your  mind, and I  just  wanted some words.  In  fact,  these words  are just created so  that the  spaces  between  them  can be utilized  for hiding  messages.  Yes,  that's  right. The  input  string is converted to  binary.  And this  file  be modified.  Wherever,  there's  a  zero, it  implies  a single space  and double space for  1.  I hope my  conversion is  helpful. And  this  input file should  be  long if the  message  is long  since it has  to have  spaces  for 1's and  0's
