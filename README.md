# Assorted Lab Practicals #

----

#### What is it? ####
----
A collection of the programs that I did as part of the lab programming exercised during my four years of undergraduate studies at _D.R. B.R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar_


#### Who is this for? ####
----
This repo targets the undergraduate students of any university pursuing *Computer Science/ Electronics Engg* and even for the *teachers* teaching the course. 
Subjects are fairly common and the most programs are mainstream


#### What subjects/courses are in here? ####
----
The course consists of following subjects in no particular order. Care has been taken to list the subjects in the order in which they appear in the B.Tech/B.S curriculum
```
    Bash Scripting
    File handling
    Strings
    Queues
    Stacks
    Trees
    Hashing
    Graphs
    Dynamic Programming
    Data Structures Micro Project
    Operating Systems
    Cryptography (ISS)

    Network/Socket Programming
    Neural Nets
    Haskell Fiddles
    Assembly Programming
    System Programming

    Web development
```

#### I'm copying your programs blindly. ####
----
Sure, go ahead. The important thing is to understand the concept. I've tried my best to ensure that the programs remain error-free. If you notice any errors, let me know. If possible, do star and share for the benefits of others alike



#### I want to contribute ####
----
Be my guest. Fork the project and submit a PR. I'm not too picky about code quality but a little beautification wouldn't hurt.




#### Quality of some programs is dreadful ####
----
Cut me some slack. You'd surely notice that as I progressed into the bottom mentioned courses, the quality of the code as well as its reusability, formatting, everything improved drastically. If you're so picky about the code quality, why not submit a PR?
