Attempt to create and analyze interaction graph by studying the composition of general n functions

An attempt to model biological cells and their interactions as a directed graph and to study their properties.
(JAVA) The base model comprises of getting the input in the form of (n) boolean functions. After studying
functional decomposition of a function in respect to other given functions, model an interaction graph that
depicts the flow between any two functions. The interaction graph is further broke down into subsets
which include the graphs with complete edges as well as the graph with at least a single cycle. The inputs
are the combinations of n functions. Ulterior motive is to generalize the results for n functions.
